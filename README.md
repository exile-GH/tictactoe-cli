# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game of strategy, where each 
player tries to create a three-symbol long line out of X's or O's.


## Steps:

1. Players pick **X** or **O**, whichever symbol they prefer to use in the game.
2. Players try to make a three symbol long straight line that is made up of
   their symbols to win.
3. If their goal is impossible, it is called a *Cat's Game*, or a tie.
4. A player should also try to stop their opponent from getting three in a row as well.
 
## Rules:

1. The line can be done three different ways if it is to count:
    * **Horizontal**
